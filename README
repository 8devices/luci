FFLuCI - Freifunk Lua Configuration Interface

This is a leightweight MVC-Webframework for small embedded devices.
It uses the the Lua programming language and relies on Haserl.

It consists of several parts:

MVC Dispatcher
	Simple PATH_INFO based dispatching mechanism using Lua modules


Template engine
	Support for plain and compiled templates, on-demand compiling support
	Short markups:
		<% Lua-Code %> 
		<%= Lua-Code with return value %>
		<%:i18nkey default translation%>
		<%+template-to-be-included%>
		<%~uci.short.cut%>

	Predefined variables for controller dir and media dir
	

Configuration Bind Interface (CBI)
	Generates and validates XHTML-Forms out of an UCI model description
	Makes it very easy to create webinterface pages that manipulate UCI files


i18n Translation support
	Simple multi-language per-module internationalization support


UCI wrapper support
	Lua UCI-Wrapper adapting the CLI of the uci binary


Menu Building support
	Supports menu building for modules and exported actions


HTTP-Abstraction and Formvalue validation support
	HTTP-Redirect, Statuscode, Content-Type abstraction
	Dynamic formvalue validation support including varaible type and
	value range validation

	
Known issues:
	There is a bug in older versions of busybox-httpd (as those in Kamikaze 7.09)
	that do not handle Status-headers correctly making valid HTTP-Redirects impossible.
	Using a newer version of Kamikaze should fix this.
